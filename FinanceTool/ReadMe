Finance Analysis
Author: Andrew Petersen

The purpose of this subrepo is to act as a container for all projects and improvements involving my personal financial analysis tool.

The current tool is Excel based, however the limitations and overhead of personalization has led me to transition the tool to Dash, a
Plotly library built on top of Matplotlib that allows for nice visual graph representation. The project will be created and edited in 
Jupyter Lab - while being managed in GitHub.
